# Langchain Experimental (if using tools like PythonREPLTool from here)
langchain_experimental>=0.0.50

# For Code Execution Tool (PythonREPLTool)
# No specific extra package, but relies on a working Python environment.

# --- Optional, but good for development ---
# black>=23.0.0              # Code formatter
# ruff>=0.1.0                # Linter

# --- Notes ---
# - Versions are indicative; update as needed based on compatibility.
# - Some langchain tools might pull their own specific dependencies.
# - If you encounter "module not found" errors, you might need to add more specific packages.
# - For Rdata, rds, sav, ensure the respective libraries (pyreadr, pyreadstat) are tested
#   and compatible with your LangChain loaders or custom processing logic.
#   You might need custom document loaders for these if LangChain doesn't directly support them.
